Why: 
When it comes to the early stages of any project whether it is a website, game, app, no matter the coding language having a clear idea of what the structure will look like can save a lot of time and hassle. It can be difficult to mentally process what something will look like, let alone the complexity of the interactions solely through looking at the code or understand the hierarchy. Giving yourself or your team a clear picture of what a site or app and all the interactions sets everyone off in the right direction and removes ambiguity from the initial stages of the project.


How:
Using maps, flow charts, wireframes, and data collected in the early phases should drive the design and interactions of the site or app. Using an app like draw.io makes it super easy to create these types of plans.

What:
The result should be a more cohesive team and a clear picture moving forward. Often times the start of a project and establishing direction is the hardest part of a project.

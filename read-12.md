* With ejs your can handle each part of your webpage as partials that way the end user doesn't need to go to a different static page when they need new information.

* With ejs is also cuts down on the amount of repeated code that needs to be uploaded.

* It's pretty easy, wrap your html in ejs tags and send it!

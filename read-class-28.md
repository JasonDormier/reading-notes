* A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

* A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

* A Digraph has a direction, each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what the node should be referencing

* Complete - A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes

* Connected- A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.

* Disconnected - A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.

* Acyclic Graph - An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles. Mean it can't come back on itself in a circle

* A cycle is when a node can be travered through and potentially end up back at itself

* Adjacency Matrix- is represented through a 2-d array 

* Adjacency List - is the most common way to represent a graph

* Weighted Graph - A weighted graph is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges. The numbers are called weights

* When representing a weighted graph in a matrix, you set the element in the 2D array to represent the actual weight between the two paths. If there is not a connection between the two vertices, you can put a 0, although it is known for some people to put the infinity sign instead

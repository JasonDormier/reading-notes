* Debugging is about deduction: eliminating potential causes of an error.

* Take advantage of the console's in each browser

* log to the console

* console methods - `<console.info>`, `<console.error>`, `<console.warn>`, `<console.table>`, `<console.assert>`

* Group messages

* Breakpoints- so you can step through your code one step at a time

* Conditional breakpoint - You can indicate that a breakpoint should be triggered only if a condition that you specify is met

* Debugger as a keyword for a breakpoint - just type in the debugger and the code will stop when it hits that point in the code

* Exceptions - Try, Catch, Finally

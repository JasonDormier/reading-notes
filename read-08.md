* SQL is a database that stores information in excel like tables 

* To make a selection from a table you can use the following operations

* =, !=, < <=, >, >=	Standard numerical operators	col_name != 4

* BETWEEN … AND …	Number is within range of two values (inclusive)	col_name BETWEEN 1.5 AND 10.5

* NOT BETWEEN … AND …	Number is not within range of two values (inclusive)	col_name NOT BETWEEN 1 AND 10

* IN (…)	Number exists in a list	col_name IN (2, 4, 6)

* NOT IN (…)	Number does not exist in a list	col_name NOT IN (1, 3, 5)

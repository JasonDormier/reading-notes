* An array stores a list of values. 

* A script is series of statements. 

* Scripts contain very precise instructions. 

* Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.

* JavaScript can tell the difference between numbers, strings, and Boolean values.

* Expressions evaluate into a single value. Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

Operators | Examples | Results
---------|---------|---------
addition + | 1+1 | 2
subraction - | 3-2 | 1
Division / | 20/10 | 2
Multiplication * |5 * 5 | 25
Increment ++ | i=1 i++ | 2
Decrement -- | i=1 i-- | 0
Modulus % | 10%3 | 1
Assignment = | i = car | 
Is equal to == | 10 == 10  | true
Is not equal to != | 10 != 10 | false
Strict equal to === | 10 === "10" | false
Strict not equal to !== | 10 !== "10"| true
Greater than > | 4 > 3| true
Less than < | 3 < 4 | true
Greater than or equal to >= | 4 >= 4 | true
Less than or equal to <= | 4 <= 4 | true
Logical and && | true && true | true
 "" | true && false | false
 "" | false && true | false
 "" | false && false | false
Logical or | true or true | true
 "" |true or false | true
 "" | false or true | true
 "" | false or false | false
Logical not ! | !true | false

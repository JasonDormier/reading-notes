* `<img>` element is used to add an image to a web page.

* Photos are best saved as JPG format for web.

* Use GIF or PNG format when saving images with few colors or large areas of the same color.

* Images for the web should be 72ppi.

* GIF, JPG, and PNG belong to an image format known as bitmap.

* `<figcaption>` has been added for HTML5 to add captions to images

* Color can be added via RGB values, HEX codes, HSL, or color names.

* `rgba(0,0,0,0.5)` red, green, blue, and opacity channel settings in order.

* `HSL(100%,100%,100%,0.5)` Hue, level, saturation, ocapcity chanel settings in order.

* Serif Typeface - Serif fonts have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letters. 

* Sans-Serif Typeface - Sans-serif fonts have straight ends to letters.

* Monospace Typeface - Just don't do this please Lol ;) same with comic sans ms, just no.

* Text weight, style, and spacing can all be adjusted in css.

* There is a limited fonts that you can expect installed on local computers but places like fontspace offer a solution for a wider selection.

* I repeat no comic sans ms.

* Psedo classes can be used to change styles when the user hovers over, clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.

*  Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, justified, and indented.

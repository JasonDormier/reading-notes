##### Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?
* You don't need them because of client side routing libraries.

##### If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?
* Inside the <BrowserRouter />, outside a <Route />

##### What does props.children contain?
* Is a prop that is always passed that contains every component that can be used to render the content

### Vocabulary Terms

##### Composition
* the act of combining parts or elements to form a whole, components are the UI building blocks in React applications like pure functions are the building blocks of function composition.

##### Children / Child Components
* are the children nested in a jsx page associated with the parent page.

##### Hash Routing
* has a unique application endpoint /app/ controlled by one single back-end action and multiple hashtags managed by Javascript that define the SPA routes.

##### Link Routing
* Provides declarative, accessible navigation around your application

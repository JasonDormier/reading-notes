### Layouts

* `<postion:aboslute>` The box will be taken out of normal flow, you can specify where you would like it to be in relation to the containing element.

* `<postion:relative>` Postion the element relative to where it would have been.

* `<postion:static>` This is the default setting for html elements.

* `<postion:fixed>` The element will remain in a fixed postion inside its containing element.

* z-index - Control the stack order of an element. If you have two elements sitting on top of one another the designer can use z-index to deceide what the stack order is.

* float - float an element all the way left or right in the containing element.

* clear floats to make sure no elements will compete to the left or right of that element inside the containing element.

* solution to floats, just don't use floats. :D

* Fixed width layout or static design does not adjust to the browser size. 

*  Liquid Layouts will adjust to the browser size.

* Grids are a fantastic way to layout a page and make sure it has a nice flow.

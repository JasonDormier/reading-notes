### The code Iâ€™m still ashamed of
* This is a good article in the sense of personal morals. There are a lot of things to consider when working. These kinds of decisions are not exclusive to programming, but having a strong sense of your own morals and ethics will go a long way to help you decide what jobs you take and what jobs you say no to. I think morals and ethics become much clearer as you age, but the younger you are the more blurry that line is, so I can see how that would be a tough call.
 
### Microsoft AI principles
* AI is one of those areas of big-time concern when it comes to privacy, morals, and ethics. AI is capable of doing things so much more efficiently and faster than humans, and with computers getting faster and more powerful, the things AI can do are even more impressive every day. It is supremely important to have strong guidelines driven by strong ethics and morals when it comes to AI, otherwise, Skynet could be the real deal. :D

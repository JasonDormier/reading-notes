### What Google Learned about Teams

This is a good article. I have read in the past for other classes. 
The main take away is that in order for groups to function most efficiently 
everyone needs to feel safe to share and contribute to the group. It doesn't 
require a group of "genius" people to come up with some "genius" solution. 
It just takes a group of whoever, and if everyone feels safe and gets the same 
amount of input in the end the group is going to be successful.Â

* Place the jQuery loading script at the end of the html before the closing `</body>` tag like js scripts
* Pair programming- one driver and one navigator
* The driver is doing the typing 
* The navigator is doing the talking
* For keys to learning and language - Listening, SPeaking, Reading, and Writing
* Pair programming is more efficient
* It makes writing code more engaging
* More growth opportunity
* Improved social skills
* Ready for the real world

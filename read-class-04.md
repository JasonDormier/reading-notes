##### Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
  * continuous improvement
  * enhances consistency
  * improved productivity
 
##### In what case would you need to use `beforeEach()` or `afterEach()` in a test suite?
  * `beforEach()` and  `afterEach()` would be used for test cases that have repetition across multiple tests
 
##### What is one downside of Test Driven Development
  * Tests can be hard to write and can slow down the development
 
##### What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
  * Classes defines a type that can be instantiated at runtime and prototype is just an object
 
##### Why REST?
  * Flexibility
  * Diversity in call types
  * It returns different data formats
 
###  Vocabulary Terms
 
##### functional programming
  * self-contained functions that accomplish specific tasks that can be used over and over again
 
##### object-oriented programming (OOP)
  * programming based on using objects that contain data and code in the form of procedures
 
##### class
  * `class` creates a new class with a given name using prototype-based inheritance. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/class)
 
##### super
  * `super` is a keyword used to access and call functions on an object’s parent. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/super)
 
##### this
  * `this` A property of an execution context that is always a reference to an object [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)
 
##### Test Driven Development (TDD)
  * Software development process that relies on software requirements being converted to test cases
 
##### Jest
  * is a javascript testing framework
 
##### Continuous Integration (CI)
  * is a development practice where devs integrate code into a shared repo
 
##### REST
  * Representational State Transfer
 
##### Data Model
  * an abstract model that organizes elements of data and stanadizes them [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org)

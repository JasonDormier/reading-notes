##### Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)
* is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class with one single instance
 
##### Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes
*  It helps to dry out your code further. It restricts the instance of the class to a single instantiation
 
##### If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?
*  No idea, but I'm sure it will involve singleton and a lot of pain and tears. I'm also fairly sure I'll find out this week
 
##### Router Middleware
* Router middleware works the same a regular middleware except that it is bound to an instance
 
##### Dynamic Module Loading
* instead of static loading, modules are loaded at runtime when they are needed
 
##### Singleton Pattern
* is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class with one single instance
 
 
##### CRUD -> REST Method Matches
* C.R.U.D. - create, read, update, delete. R.E.S.T. POST, GET, PUT, DELETE
 
##### Mock Testing
* is an approach to unit testing that allows the dev to make assertions about how the code is interacting with other system modules.

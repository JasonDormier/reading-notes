### Props and State

##### Does a deployed React application require a server?
* No, but it can certainly be complemented by a solid back end
 
##### Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?
* Preforming the tests at the behavior will give you accurate and consistent tests. Unit-level tests are more likely to be inconsistent. 
 
##### What does npm run build do?
* When you are ready for production npm build will optimize or minimize a large portion of your code and deploy it into a folder you determine. It will also convert scss/sass files into css files.
 
##### Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application
* React is a component-based system. It is made up of parts that make the whole.
 
### Vocabulary Terms

* Behavior Driven Development is a form of test-driven development that uses human-readable descriptions of the requirements.
 
##### Acceptance Tests
* Testing to see whether or not the software has met the required specifications.
 
##### mounting
* Integration of the hard drive into the systems operating system.
 
##### build

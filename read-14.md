* Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.

* By limiting a table to one purpose you reduce the number of duplicate data contained within your database.

* There are three main reasons to normalize a database. 

* The first is to minimize duplicate data. 

* The second is to minimize or avoid data modification issues. 

* The third is to simplify queries. 

* Definitions of Database Normalization -

* First Normal Form – The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.

* Second Normal Form – The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table’s primary key.

* Third Normal Form – the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key

* Mustache allows you to render a webpage using a .json data page
 
* Display flex enable flex context for all children
 
```css
.container {
  display: flex; /* or inline-flex */
}
 
```
* order controls the order in which elements appear
```css
.item {
  order: 5; /* default is 0 */
}
```
* Flex align items - aligns items horizontally on the page. with `<flex-start>`, `<flex-end>`,`<center>`,`<stretch>`, and `<baseline>`.
 
* justify-content aligns elements relative to the elements around it.
 
* FLex-flow is a shorthand for flex-direction and flex-wrap which define the flex's main and cross axes.
